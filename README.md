# H5P Music Notation


This H5P module allows you to display musical notations and model various tasks in the field of music theory interactively and in a user-friendly way. This module requires the [H5P Music Notation Controller](https://github.com/H5P-MusicNotation/H5P-MusicNotation) and [Notation Widget](https://github.com/mnowakow/h5p-notation-widget) to work.

You will find the h5p-file of the current version in the "h5p-package" folder.

## Features
### Interactive Tasks
Based on interaction with the [VIBE Editor](https://github.com/mnowakow/VIBE), a mixture of the following tasks can be assessed:

- Pitch: Check for the correct pitch class of the notes (single, chord, or polyphonic).
- Octave Position: Check for the correct octave position of each note.
- Duration: Check for the correct position and contents of harmony labels.
- Harmony Labels: Check for the correct position and contents of harmony labels.
- Textboxes: Check for the right contents of any annotation box within the editor.

### Upload Music Markup
You can create your music notation in the editor or import any MusicXML or MEI file.

### Grading
The tasks can be graded or used as self-assessment for the students with retries and solutions.
